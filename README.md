# learning-the-ropes
====================
Hello m8's!
I do bartending for a living, learning when and what i can. [Newb wannabe coder:)]
Trying to learn the ropes as i go, but seems that i have a lot to cover.
All in all, hope to get some help from the masters.
And with that being said i wish you all happy coding.
Over and out.
